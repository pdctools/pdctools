Ok, first of all we need to check out what is already available out there:

- `smbldap-tools <https://gna.org/projects/smbldap-tools/>`_ (I think these are the perl scripts Emiliano was talking about... )
- `Apache directory <http://directory.apache.org/>`_
- `FreeIPA <http://www.freeipa.org>`_ (I have no clue about the features in these projects... I just searched around for active directory alternatives and such)
- `OpenDJ <http://opendj.forgerock.org>`_

then, we may find `this <http://opensource.bolloretelecom.eu/projects/django-ldapdb/>`_ useful

if you want to add documentation, `this is the guide <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_

for example, this is a link to a file containing the author names:

:doc:`people`
